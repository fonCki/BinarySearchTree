### Assignment 1
Before you start coding consider the ADT and make sure you know exactly what to do. You are going to make a generic tree, that is a tree that can store any kind of type (but for the BST it must implement the comparable interface). The traversals return an ArrayList of the objects in the tree, you don’t need to return an iterator. You don’t need to support more than one occurrence of each element either.

#### It’s recommended to build the tree in phases:

- A binary tree.
- A binary search tree with add and remove.
- A binary search tree with rebalance.
